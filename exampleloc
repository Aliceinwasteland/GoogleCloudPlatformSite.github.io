To create a new, empty translation memory, follow these steps::
Click the Add button at the top of the sidebar in your translation memories list page.
Select Shared with everyone to allow all other users to search your translation memory. Select Not shared with everyone to restrict access to your translation memory only to those users whom you explicitly grant access.  Important: you cannot change this setting after you create the translation memory.  If you accidentally share a translation memory that should not have been shared with everyone, you must delete the translation memory.  At that point, you must wait for a few hours for Google Translator Toolkit to remove the translation memory content from our translation search index.  
Click Save. 
When prompted to create an empty translation memory, click OK. The new, empty translation memory appears in your translation memories list.

To create a new translation memory from an existing file, follow these steps:
