      <h1>Google Cloud Platform Program Guide</h1>
		<h2>I. Program Overview:</h2>
		<p><strong>Program purpose:</strong> The purpose of the Google Cloud Platform Program is to enable participants to build their practices or products on the Google Cloud Platform, and to support and recognize participants as they reach higher levels of success.</p>
		<p><strong>Program guide:</strong> Participation in this Program is governed by the terms of the Cloud Platform Program Agreement between the parties and this Google Cloud Platform Program Guide (&ldquo;Program Guide&rdquo;). The Program Guide details the benefits and requirements associated with each level of the Program. Participation in the Program does not create any agency, partnership or joint venture between the participant and Google.</p>
		<p><strong>Participant types:</strong> The Program is designed for two participant types: <strong>Services participants</strong> and <strong>Technology participants</strong>:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><em>Services participants</em> provide consulting and implementation services on various Google Cloud Platform products. Clients can use Services participants&rsquo; knowledge and expertise to create applications and implement solutions for a variety of use cases.
		  </li>
		  <li><em>Technology participants</em> either provide tools which integrate with the Google Cloud Platform to extend its reach and functionality, or use one of the Google Cloud Platform products as a foundation for their products.
		  </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each participant type has three levels - <strong>Registered Company</strong>, <strong>Authorized Partner</strong> and <strong>Premier Partner</strong>- as described below.</p>
		<p>If you have any questions regarding the content of the Program Guide, please contact a Google partner manager.</p>
		<h2><a name="h.hgse92vffj89"></a>IA. Services Participants:</h2>
		<ol>
		<li><em>Generally</em>: The Program enables new and existing Services participants to develop competencies to sell, build, deliver, support and maintain applications and implement solutions for clients on Google&rsquo;s Cloud Platform products. Services participants include systems integrators, IT consulting firms, application developers, and other professional services and IT solution providers.
		</li>
		<li><em>Program Levels</em>. There are three levels to the Program (collectively, &ldquo;Levels&rdquo;) for Services participants:</li>
		<ol>
		<li><em>Registered Company</em>: This Level includes companies that have completed a Google Cloud Platform Program application, have satisfied the Registered Company and any other then-current requirements, and have executed a Google Cloud Platform Program Agreement.
		</li>
		<li><em>Authorized Services Partner</em>: This Level includes companies that have executed a Google Cloud Platform Program Agreement, have completed an Authorized Services Partner application, have satisfied the Authorized
		Services Partner and any other then-current requirements, and have been formally accepted by Google, in Google&rsquo;s sole discretion, as an Authorized Services Partner. Google will provide partners with notification of acceptance to the Program/Level, which notification may be by e-mail or by other appropriate means. These companies will also be given the opportunity to execute, a Google Cloud Platform Reseller Agreement. These companies may refer to themselves as a &ldquo;Google Cloud Platform Authorized Services Partner.&rdquo;</li>
		<li><em>Premier Services Partner</em>: This Level is reserved for companies that have executed a Google Cloud Platform Program Agreement, have completed a Premier Services Partner application, and have satisfied the
		Premier Services Partner and any other then-current requirements. These companies will also be given the opportunity to execute, in their sole discretion, a Google Cloud Platform Reseller Agreement, if they have not done so already. These companies may refer to themselves as a &ldquo;Google Cloud Platform Premier Services Partner.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>For purposes of clarification, advancement from Registered Company to Authorized Services Partner is by invitation only and at Google&rsquo;s sole discretion, based on participant&rsquo;s application and qualifications. Once a company has become an Authorized Partner, however, advancement from Authorized Services Partner to Premier Services Partner will be granted automatically if the company has met the Premier Services Partner requirements.</li>
		</ol>
		<li><em>Program Benefits and Requirements</em>. The requirements for participation in the Program as a Google Cloud Platform Registered Company, Authorized Services Partner, or Premier Services Partner, as well as the benefits of
		membership in a given level, are set forth in the tables below and the remainder of this Program Guide. </li>
