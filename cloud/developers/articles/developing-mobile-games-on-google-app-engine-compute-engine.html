  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>The mobile gaming market is growing rapidly and is expected to be a $16 billion business by 2016<sup><a href="#ftnt1" name="ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup>. In Q4 of 2012, global spending on games for Apple's iOS and Google's Android platforms actually exceeded the spending on dedicated handheld games<sup><a href="#ftnt2" name="ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

  <p>The mobile game revenue model is shifting from paid games to games that are free to play, where revenue is generated from virtual goods, other in-game purchases, as well as from in-game advertising. With these new trends there is a demand for mobile games to be more engaging and immersive.</p>

  <p>Such games not only require attractive user experiences on the client, but also rich and scalable backend services. Google Cloud Platform allows you to easily build your mobile game backend as presented in this solution paper.</p>

  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>This document is intended for architects and developers interested in building their own mobile game backends and designing the interaction patterns between mobile clients and the backend.</p>

  <p>The approach and architecture presented in this document are applicable to a new development of a typical mobile game. However, there are also two other alternatives that may be relevant, depending on your scenario and requirements. The first one is <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud/samples/mbs/">Mobile Backend Starter</a>, which you can consider if you prefer to get s<a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud/samples/mbs/">t</a>arted without having to develop your own custom mobile game backend. The second one is the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/articles/dedicated-server-gaming-solution">Dedicated Server Gaming Solution</a> architecture, which you can consider if your mobile game requires the use of dedicated game servers.</p>

  <p>This document covers the development of highly scalable new mobile games on Google Cloud Platform. It applies the mobile solutions reference architecture published <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/articles/mobile-application-solutions.html">here</a> while providing more details and examples, specific to building mobile games. The paper is accompanied by a sample mobile game application with full source code.</p>

  <p>Building the client part of mobile games is not covered in this document. However, the document does include some basic information relevant to communicating with the mobile game backend, authenticating users, and sending push notifications.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>Typical requirements for a compelling mobile game include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Game features:
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic game content</li>
        <li>Game data stored outside of devices</li>
        <li>Leaderboard</li>
        <li>Multiplayer mode</li>
        <li>Player matching</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Building your mobile game on Google Cloud Platform can help you meet these requirements.</p>

  <h1>Mobile gaming solutions architecture</h1>
  <p>The following diagram (Fig. 1) illustrates the high level architecture for mobile games on Google Cloud Platform:</p>

    <img src="/cloud/images/articles/developing-mobile-games-on-gcp/architecture-diag.jpg">
    <figcaption>Figure 1. Architecture Diagram of the proposed Mobile Gaming Solution</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>High-level overview</h3>
  <p>The key components in the proposed solution architecture are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your mobile game client - any combination of Android, iOS and HTML/JavaScript applications.</li>
    <li>Your mobile game backend application.</li>
    <li>The communication layer between your mobile game clients and your mobile backend.</li>
    <li>Several cloud services for storing your game data and images, delivering push notifications, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The roles of key components</h3>
  <p>One of the design choices is to determine what functionality of your mobile game will be fulfilled by each component of the solution. In particular, what functionality will be implemented in your client application and what functionality will be implemented by your mobile game backend and provided by the cloud services.</p>
  <p>With smartphones and tablets becoming more powerful, it is practical to implement as much functionality as possible in the game clients.  The main role of your mobile game backend is to enrich the overall experience, make it more engaging and immersive, and deliver functionality that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible with just a client application itself.</p>
  <p>Many popular mobile games use mobile backends to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deliver dynamic game content</li>
    <li>Facilitate multiplayer games, including matching players</li>
    <li>Store data outside of the mobile  device, e.g., the last completed level, or the scores achieved in the previous plays</li>
    <li>Manage the leaderboard</li>
    <li>Orchestrate push notifications</li>
    <li>Facilitate in-game purchases</li>
    <li>Provide game analytics</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Your Mobile Game Backend<sup><a href="#ftnt3" name="ftnt_ref3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup> in the Cloud</h3>
  <p>When using Google Cloud Platform to power your mobile game, you can run your game backend on Google App Engine - a platform that is used by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/gaming">many successful online games</a> developed by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/#cp-mobile">small and large companies</a>. It provides the following benefits of the Google Infrastructure:</p>

  <h1>Developing a mobile game on Google Cloud Platform</h1>

  <h2>Sample game scenario</h2>
  <p>The architecture discussed in this document is applicable to many mobile games. A sample scenario presented below is used primarily to make the design more specific. Most of the discussed design choices are relevant to other mobile games as well.</p>

  <h3>Griddler - multiplayer riddle mobile game</h3>
  <p>Imagine that you want to build a trivia or riddle multiplayer mobile game named Griddler. Two or more players will compete to solve as many riddles as they can within a specific time frame. This competition will be referred to as a game. Each player in a game is presented with the same grid of letters, for example a grid like this one:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/cloud/images/articles/developing-mobile-games-on-gcp/griddler.png" height="195" width="196">
    <figcaption>Figure 2. Griddler screenshot</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Each player will be challenged with the same series of riddles for a single grid. For example a first riddle can be:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/cloud/images/articles/developing-mobile-games-on-gcp/sample-q.png" height="396" width="222">
    <figcaption>Figure 3. Sample question on Griddler</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Each player needs to figure out what the answer should be and then make a touch gesture to build the right word out of adjacents letters on a grid, as shown in Figure 4.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/cloud/images/articles/developing-mobile-games-on-gcp/answ-entry-griddler.png" height="396" width="222">
    <figcaption>Figure 4. Answer entry in Griddler</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>When a player finds the correct word or decides to skip a given riddle, she is challenged with another riddle for the same grid, as shown in Figure 5.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/cloud/images/articles/developing-mobile-games-on-gcp/riddle-griddler.png" height="396" width="222">
    <figcaption>Figure 5. Another sample riddle in Griddler</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Game clients retrieve the board definition from the mobile game backend at the start of each game. This way, new boards and riddles can be added without the need to update client applications. The sequence of the riddles for a given board can be random or fixed. The retrieved board definition includes the riddles for that board along with the time allotment for a given game. When the allotted time is reached, the player who solves the most riddles wins. If there is a tie, the player who solved the riddles quickest wins the round. </p>
  <p>At any given time, there may be millions of games in play, each played by 1 to N players.  Additionally, Griddler has a single player mode which can be used to practice the game mechanics or to simply solve riddles for fun.</p>
  <p>Besides serving board definitions to the clients, the responsibilities of the mobile game backend include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Managing the list of players and their statistics (for example, how many games a player played across different devices, how many multiplayer games she won).</li>
    <li>Managing the list of devices used by players in order to be able to send push notifications to these devices.</li>
    <li>Sending game invitations for multiplayer games.</li>
    <li>Relaying invitation acceptance, declines and cancellations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key components of mobile gaming solutions</h2>
  <p>You can easily implement Griddler and other mobile games on the architecture discussed in this document. The clients can be implemented as native iOS and Android applications. The mobile game backend can run on Google App Engine. Google Cloud Endpoints can be used to expose API from the mobile backend and consume this API from the clients.</p>
  <h3>
    The mobile game client applications</h3>
  <p>The Android and iOS client applications are responsible for all user interface and user interactions for the game as well as for the game mechanics. The design for this functionality is not that different from the design of a mobile game that doesn&rsquo;t use any mobile game backend and as such is beyond the scope of this document.</p>
  <p>What is different is that Griddler clients are powered by a mobile game backend. The client communicates with the backend to facilitate multi-player games and player matching. This includes handling received push notifications with game invitations sent by the backend. The client also retrieves from the backend any dynamic game content, such as a board definition for a given game. This includes the grid of letters and all the riddles for a given grid, as well as the valid answers for these riddles.</p>
  <p>Once a game starts, whether it is a single player game or multiplayer game, the client doesn&rsquo;t have to communicate with the backend until the game ends. Then the client submits game results to the mobile game backend and the backend stores the results and determines who won a multiplayer game.</p>

  <h3>The mobile game backend</h3>
  <p>The mobile game backend needs to expose the appropriate API for the client to enable the desired game mechanics and user experience.</p>
  <p>Griddler API includes methods for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Game Management, for example startNewSinglePlayerGame (which among other things retrieves a board definition) and gameFinished.</li>
    <li>Player Invitations, for example sendInvitation, acceptInvitation etc.</li>
    <li>Notifications, for example registerDeviceForPushNotification.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These methods can be exposed to the clients as described in the <a href="#cbym">next section</a>.</p>
  <p>When handling synchronous API requests, the mobile backend <a href="#storedata">stores, retrieves and manages data in a persistent store</a> and for frequently accessed data, such as board definitions, it also uses <a href="#odawm">memory cache</a>.</p>
  <p>Besides handling requests from the client, the mobile backend is responsible for <a href="#odawm">asynchronous processing</a> that is required for the mobile game, <a href="#pushnotifications">orchestrating push notifications</a>, handling <a href="#scheduled">scheduled tasks</a> and so on.</p>

  <a name="cbym"></a>
  <h3>Communication between your mobile game clients and your mobile game backend</h3>
  <p>As discussed in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/articles/mobile-application-solutions">Mobile Solutions paper</a>, the recommended way of exposing API from your mobile backend and consuming it from your mobile client is to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/overview">Google Cloud Endpoints</a><sup><a href="#ftnt4" name="ftnt_ref4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup>.  This technology allows you to define your API through straightforward annotations in your source code and to use tools to generate strongly typed Android and iOS client libraries, as well as JavaScript code for interacting with your API from web clients. It also provides support for OAuth2-based authentication with Google accounts, so your mobile game backend code can know the identity of the player.</p>
  <p>For example in Griddler, the method for sending an invitation is declared in the following way:</p>

<pre>
@ApiMethod(httpMethod = "PUT", path ="game/{gameId}/invitation/{playerId}")
public InvitationResult sendInvitation(@Named("gameId") Long gameId,
 @Named("playerId") Long playerId, User user) throws ServiceException { }
</pre>

  <p>The above code declares sendInvitation API that on the wire will be represented as HTTP PUT request using the URL specified in the path argument. The gameId and playerId arguments will be passed explicitly by the client. User object will be filled by Google Cloud Endpoints infrastructure based on the authentication information provided implicitly by the client.  You can see Cloud Endpoints<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/annotations"> </a><a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/annotations">documentation</a> for more information about @Api annotation.</p>
  <p>When Cloud Endpoints tooling is used to generate client libraries, your Android client will be able to invoke this API exposed from your mobile backend simply by calling:</p>

<pre>
InvitationResult invitationResult = gameBackend.sendInvitation(
gameId, playerId)).execute();
</pre>

  <p>Such a call should typically be run asynchronously to avoid blocking for network calls on the UI thread.</p>

  </figure>

  <a name="storedata"></a>
  <h3>Storing data<sup><a href="#ftnt5" name="ftnt_ref5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></h3>

  <p>Mobile games that are engaging and immersive typically need to store data outside of the client devices.</p>

  <p>Some mobile games may want to use dynamic content represented as large and typically binary objects. This includes images that define parts of a virtual game world or avatars uploaded by the players. For this kind of data, you can use <a href="http://developers.google.com/storage/docs/getting-started">Google Cloud Storage</a>, a service that can store objects and files up to terabytes in size. See also &ldquo;<a href="#sapi">Serving and processing images</a>&rdquo; below.</p>
  <p>The other types of data that need to be stored outside of the client devices are fine-grained properties and entities.  These properties and entities might include information about the highest completed level in a mobile game and other information about players, such as their nicknames, players&rsquo; device registration for push notification, records of their in-game purchases, and other game-specific data.</p>
  <p>The properties of these entities can also include a reference to objects stored in Google Cloud Storage, such as the object name and, optionally, a bucket name or URL.</p>
  <p>With your mobile backend hosted on Google App Engine, the recommended place to store such entities is <a href="https://developers.google.com/datastore/">Cloud Datastore</a>. It provides a NoSQL,<sup><a href="#ftnt6" name="ftnt_ref6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup> schemaless, highly-scalable, object data store, with a query engine and atomic transactions.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/cloud/images/articles/developing-mobile-games-on-gcp/storing-data.jpg" height="350" width="305">
    <figcaption>Figure 7. Storing data</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>For example in Griddler, key entities are:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/cloud/images/articles/developing-mobile-games-on-gcp/key-entities.jpg">
    <figcaption>Figure 8. Key entities used in Griddler</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <ul>
    <li>Player</li>
    <li>Board - a definition of a game grid and the riddles for this grid.</li>
    <li>Game - an instance of one or more players competing to solve riddles on a given Board.</li>
    <li>Invitation - an entity used to initiate multiplayer games.</li>
    <li>GamePlay - an entity representing the state and results of a Game being played by a Player. For multi-player games,  there will be many GamePlay entities for a given Game (one per Player).</li>
    <li>Device - platform specific information needed for sending push notifications to a given device, (e.g., device token for iOS and GCM registration id for Android).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To support strong consistency, Invitation and GamePlay belong to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/gettingstarted/usingdatastore?hl=en">entity group</a> rooted at the Game ancestor entity. Similarly, the Device entity belongs to the entity group rooted at the Player ancestor entity.</p>
  <p>By using Datastore for storing the entities, your mobile games can easily scale to millions of players.</p>
  <p>Because Griddler doesn't use any binary or large data in the current implementation, it stores all its data in Datastore. However, if enhancements were implemented to provide visual clues for riddles or to allow players to upload their avatars, Griddler could use Google Cloud Storage to store images.</p>

  <a name="odawm"></a>
  <h3>Optimizing data access with Memcache</h3>
  <p>When the load increases, your mobile game backend can be composed from thousands of individual instances handling requests. If your mobile game clients are making frequent requests to the backend to retrieve the same data, the data access can be optimized to avoid retrieving the data from persistent storage for every request.</p>
  <p>A backend running on Google App Engine can use a distributed in-memory, data cache service called <a href="http://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/memcache/">Memcache</a> to store and retrieve frequently accessed data (Fig. 9). Using Memcache not only allows your mobile game backend to have higher performance and to scale better, but it also reduces your cost of accessing App Engine Datastore as your application will be sending fewer requests to App Engine Datastore. </p>
  <p>For example, there may be millions of players playing Griddler at the same time and there may, potentially, be up to hundreds of thousands of players solving riddles from the same board (grid of letters) at the same time. Instead of retrieving the Board definitions every time, it makes sense to cache them.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/cloud/images/articles/developing-mobile-games-on-gcp/optimizing-data.jpg" height="421" width="352">
    <figcaption>Figure 9. Optimizing data access with Memcache</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>Asynchronous processing with Task Queues</h3>
  <p>Sometimes it is not possible, or desirable, to do all the work associated with a request received from a mobile game client before the response needs to be sent back to the user&rsquo;s device.</p>
  <p>For example, to make a game more engaging and social, Griddler could have a feature to notify player&rsquo;s friends when the player achieves a very high score and makes it onto the leaderboard. This could be triggered when the client calls the gameFinished API. However, it is important to consider that a player can have many friends and the client should not be blocked until all friends are notified. Such a synchronous design would not only block the client, but also be unreliable. Instead, as part of the gameFinished API, your mobile game backend can store the game results, record the need to process notifications and immediately send the response back to the client without waiting until all notifications are processed.</p>
  <p>Your code running on Google App Engine can use a service called <a href="http://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/">Task Queues</a> to enqueue information about the work (tasks) that needs to be done asynchronously. In the example previously discussed, your application could enqueue a task to notify players&rsquo; friends that the player made it into the top 20.  </p>

  <p>Typically, you would configure Task Queue service to send the enqueued tasks (<a href="http://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/overview-push">push model</a>) to your code running on Google App Engine as HTTP requests to a chosen URL. Your mobile game backend can process these requests through regular web request handlers. In the example above, your request handler could retrieve the task information from the HTTP request, look up the player&rsquo;s friends, and then notify each of the friends, either by creating posts in a social site on behalf of the player or by sending push notifications as described <a href="#pushnotifications">below</a>.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, your mobile backend code can <a href="http://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/overview-pull">pull the</a> <a href="http://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/overview-pull">tasks</a> from the queue(s). This can be helpful, for example, if you want to explicitly control the processing of tasks. Another scenario when pull tasks are useful is when you want to process the tasks outside of App Engine, for example by Google Compute Engine instances as discussed in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/articles/mobile-application-solutions">Mobile</a> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/articles/mobile-application-solutions">Solutions</a><a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/articles/mobile-application-solutions"> paper</a>.</p>

  <a name="pushnotifications"></a>
  <h3>Push notifications</h3>
  <p>Push notifications allow game backends to notify the clients about state changes and other relevant information without the clients having to poll constantly. Push notifications can be used to create a rich user experience while optimizing battery and bandwidth usage. Depending on the client platform, your mobile game can use this technology to display &ldquo;<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts.html">toast</a><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts.html">s</a>&rdquo; and other notifications on users&rsquo; devices, even if your mobile game client is not actively running. It can also be used to keep feeding the mobile game client with the relevant data.</p>
  <p>In Griddler, push notifications are used to send invitations when a player wants to challenge a friend. Using push notifications enables inviting friends that don&rsquo;t have the game actively running on their devices.</p>
  <p>With your mobile game backend code running on Google App Engine, you can orchestrate sending push notifications to your users by leveraging the following technologies:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html">Google Cloud Messaging</a> for Android (GCM) - a Google service that allows you to send data to your users that have your mobile game client application installed on their Android-powered devices. If you use Eclipse, you can have skeleton code generated by <a href="http://developers.google.com/eclipse/">Google Plugin for Eclipse</a>.</li>
    <li>Sockets API<sup><a href="#ftnt7" name="ftnt_ref7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup> to send push notifications using Apple &reg; Push Notification Service to your iOS users. To get started, you can read a solution paper on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/articles/ios-push-notifications">Orchestrating iOS Push Notifications on Google Cloud Platform</a> and review the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-ios-push-notification-sample-backend-java">sample code published on Github.</a></li>
  </ul>

  <figure>
    <img src="/cloud/images/articles/developing-mobile-games-on-gcp/push-notification.png" height="438" width="457">
    <figcaption>Figure 10. Push Notification</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <a name="sapi"></a>
  <h3>Serving and processing images</h3>
  <p>Some static images, such as various icons that are part of your game and are used to build the UI of your client application can be packaged - often in multiple resolutions - into your native Android and iOS game clients. However, doing so increases the size of the package. If the package size is large, it can discourage users from downloading your app or make them more likely to uninstall it when they run out of space on their devices.</p>
  <p>Often it is not practical or possible to package into a client application all images that a game needs. For example, your mobile game could have large and/or dynamic virtual worlds with rich graphics that are represented as images with total size of hundreds of megabytes or gigabytes. Even if the size of the images is not that big, you may want to be able to add new graphics to your game without forcing the users to update their client apps.</p>
  <p>For example, Griddler could be expanded to include some visual clue for a given riddle. It could also allow players to upload images representing their avatars.</p>
  <p>If you can prepare such images in resolutions and formats optimized for your mobile game clients, then you can upload them to <a href="http://developers.google.com/storage/docs/getting-started">Google Cloud Storage</a> and provide direct URLs to these images to the mobile clients. This approach can scale very well as it allows mobile clients to retrieve these images directly from the scalable cloud storage without involving your mobile backend code.</p>
  <p>In some cases, you may want to manipulate and process images in addition to storing them. For example, you may want to serve the images in dynamically adjusted sizes depending on the resolution of your client devices. In such scenarios, you can use the Google App Engine <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/images/">Images Service</a> to resize, rotate, flip, and crop images, as well as to enhance photographs using a predefined algorithm. These operations can be performed on images from Google Cloud Storage and other sources. The modified images can then be served to the clients directly from the dynamic image serving infrastructure provided by Google without involving your mobile game backend code. Your code is responsible just for using the Images Service API to obtain the appropriate image URL and for providing this URL to the mobile game clients.</p>

  </figure>

  <a name="scheduled"></a>
  <h3>Scheduled jobs</h3>
  <p>Besides processing requests from the mobile game clients synchronously through Google Cloud Endpoints and asynchronously using Task Queues, your mobile game backend code may need to do some processing at various regular or semi-regular intervals. For example, you may want your mobile game backend to send push notifications to players that haven&rsquo;t played your game for some number of days and encourage them to play again, and you want to do this processing at specific times of day.</p>
  <p>Your mobile game backend may also want to update some data cached in Memcache every 5 minutes or update statistics of top players every 15 minutes.</p>
  <p>With your mobile game backend code running on Google App Engine, configuring such scheduled jobs is straightforward with the <a href="http://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/cron">Cron Service</a>. You can configure it to invoke some URLs in your mobile backend at the requested intervals or specific times.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 12. Scheduled jobs with Cron Service</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2>Google Play Game Services</h2>
  <p>An easy way to make your Android, iOS and web games more social is to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/games/services/">Google Play Game Services</a>. You can reward players with achievements, drive engagement with leaderboards, and make your game more dynamic by letting multiple players compete or cooperate simultaneously.</p>

  <h2>Sample Applications</h2>
  <p>You can download the Griddler sample application from <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-griddler-sample-backend-java">Github</a>.  The mobile backend is implemented in Java and it exposes REST API using Cloud Endpoints. It stores data in Datastore using low level API and sends push notifications. <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-griddler-sample-android-client">Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-griddler-sample-iOS-client">iOS</a> game clients are implemented as native applications. The communication between the clients and the mobile game backend is authenticated using OAuth and Google Accounts.</p>
  <p>You can also download <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-cloud-adventure-sample-backend-java">Cloud Adventure</a> - another mobile game sample built on a similar architecture. Cloud Adventure is a text-based <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-cloud-adventure-sample-android-client">Android game</a> that showcases a few interesting scenarios, such as a game lobby for multiple players and unique nickname selection. It also demonstrates how to use a combination of Google Cloud Messaging for Android and Cloud Endpoints to handle the completion of a game and tallying the results.</p>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>
  <p>If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, visit <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a> portal and click the &ldquo;Try it Now&rdquo; link.
