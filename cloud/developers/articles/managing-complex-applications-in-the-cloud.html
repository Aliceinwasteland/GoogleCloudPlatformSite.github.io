  <h2>Real world application development on the Google Cloud Platform</h2>
  <p>A growing majority of business applications today require a level of complexity not easily addressed by a single hosting service. One application may include multiple logical services, different programming languages, differing types of data storage needs, and a range of runtime requirements. In addition, teams are generally composed of developers with vastly different areas of expertise and experience. Requirements change at a pace that often leads to a level of complexity that is challenging to manage by even the largest teams.</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Google Cloud Platform has evolved to provide a complete set of tools for managing even the most complex application requirements. From a fully managed application to custom virtual machines, it gives developers the flexibility to balance administrative overhead with technical demands. On Google Cloud Platform, applications can be easily developed as separate components with vastly different technical and business requirements. These components can have their own performance configuration, budget, authorization and versioning while sharing a common set of resources. The shared resources enable a tighter integration than individual applications communicating over traditional APIs. In addition, components benefit from an integrated security model and centralized management of a Cloud project<sup><a href="#ftnt1" name="ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup>. Developing on the Cloud Platform provides a range of tools for managing growing application complexity.</p>
  <p>Whether you&rsquo;re building an application from the ground up or moving an existing custom application<sup><a href="#ftnt2" name="ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup> to the cloud, the Google Cloud Platform can provide the level of performance and functionality appropriate for your business.</p>
  <p>In this solution, we&rsquo;ll show the right tools for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Different developer expertise</li>
    <li>Different data storage requirements</li>
    <li>Interactive and batch processing requirements</li>
    <li>Custom analysis engines</li>
    <li>Logically separate business components</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scope and Scenario</h2>
  <p>This paper is designed for Solutions Architects and CTOs interested in managing the deployment and scaling of a large scale application on the Google Cloud Platform. The example presented in the paper showcases how to handle many of the complexities encountered in deploying large applications. We provide an introduction to the tools of the platform and provide links to deeper dives where relevant. The sample discussed in this paper was kept intentionally simple to focus on solving typical complexities rather than going deep into app-specific functionality.</p>
  <p>To illustrate how the Google Cloud Platform enables you to manage complex applications in the cloud, we will walk through a real-world scenario of building a video sharing community. In this scenario, users will upload videos from a mobile phone. The content will be transcoded for playback in multiple formats and finally presented on a web community site for watching and commenting. The demo application for the scenario includes the following components: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Android application for video upload and mobile backend</li>
    <li>Video transcoding pipeline</li>
    <li>Community website for video watching and commenting</li>
    <li>Comment analysis via Hadoop</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following technical challenges will be addressed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Multiple backend languages</li>
    <li>Multiple independent developers or teams</li>
    <li>Mix of managed applications and custom binaries</li>
    <li>Multiple data storage requirements</li>
    <li>Dynamic scaling for batch processing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can also watch a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT019zkUMF0">live demo</a> we gave at Google I/O 2013.</p>

  <h3>Managing the Deployment and Scaling of Web Services</h3>
  <p>For the deployment and maintenance of a typical web property, there is a significant amount of overhead associated with the administration of the underlying network, systems, and services. App Engine alleviates those concerns by providing a completely managed application platform. It automatically handles scaling out and back resources in response to demand. Versioning is another powerful feature that allows developers to easily handle rollbacks, divide customer traffic across releases, and conduct slow rollout of new releases. For web workloads, App Engine helps a developer to completely focus on building the best applications.</p>
  <p>The web part of the video sharing site was built on App Engine to leverage these unique benefits. This component was written in one of the web&rsquo;s most popular languages, PHP. PHP support on App Engine brings all the benefits of automatic scaling, versioning, and performance paired with the rapid development enabled by a language built for the web. Most existing PHP applications will run with minimal changes in the App Engine environment.</p>
  <p>Since many web development teams are familiar with MySQL, we opted to use a database technology that should be very familiar to them:  Google Cloud SQL. Cloud SQL provides compatibility with the MySQL functionality and SQL protocol, allowing for a simple transition of existing workloads. In addition, Google handles the complexity of high availability and backups behind the scenes. In the sample, Cloud SQL was used for the primary storage of user data and video metadata.</p>
  <p>For storage of video files and thumbnails, we opted for Google Cloud Storage. Cloud Storage supports large file sizes and direct delivery to our application clients. It also provides an optional, built-in edge cache for global distribution of our video content. For uploads, Cloud Storage provides time-limited writeable URLs to allow file uploads directly from the client. This reduces the need for spending valuable application resources relaying files to storage.</p>
  <p>For user activity on the site, namely comments, we anticipated a growth at a substantially higher scale and opted to use App Engine&rsquo;s NoSQL database, High Replication Datastore. HRD provides a level of scalability unmatched by pure SQL solutions and is a good match for high volume data access. The choice also opened us up to the use of the newly released Cloud Datastore, providing access to our user activity across the Cloud Platform and externally.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h3>Managing Batch Processing Pipelines</h3>
  <p>Most large web sites today require some level of batch processing. The workloads may include processing of uploaded content, updating user data, managing external notifications, or data analysis. Regardless of the business demand, batch processing pipelines are inherently difficult to build, scale, and maintain. The Google Cloud Platform provides the tools and services to simplify the task of building a scaleable and reliable processing pipeline. From a programmable compute environment to a range of storage options, the platform is tuned for distributed batch processing.</p>
  <p>Our scenario uses a batch processing pipeline to manage the uploaded video content for the application. Most video sharing sites use batch processing for their uploaded content to do everything from transcoding, watermarking, and/or digital rights management. The demand for these services tends to be extremely variable based on the sporadic upload of content versus a more steady consumption behavior. Additionally, the various components of a video pipeline tend to require custom applications or code that are not suitable for a strictly PaaS (Platform as a Service) environment. Both factors make Compute Engine an excellent fit. Scaling for a typical data center or managed hosting typically requires purchasing capacity ahead of time or paying for hour-long blocks. Google Compute Engine provides extremely fast spin-up for instances (in most cases, in seconds) and fast turn-down making it a great fit for this type of workload. Additionally, Compute Engine provides extremely consistent performance as you scale out.</p>
  <p>For our environment, we utilize a combination of App Engine and Compute Engine to spin up a scalable video transcoding service on demand. Utilizing an orchestration engine written in Python on App Engine, we control Compute Engine instance behavior using the available JSON API and coordinated transcoding activity using Task Queues. The setup allows us to dynamically allocate capacity in response to demand and existing load. In addition, a periodic script checks the load in the environment and reduces capacity when it was no longer needed. This provides a strong economic benefit given the recent change to sub-hour billing on Compute Engine. Task Queues provide a way to accept, buffer and distribute requests across the video transcoding instances.</p>

  <h3>Managing Rapid Mobile Deployments</h3>
  <p>The Google Cloud Platform provides a suite of tools to enable rapid mobile application development. A combination of Cloud Endpoints and App Engine provides a platform for exposing backend server technology as an API for external consumption. Without Cloud Endpoints, adding a mobile application to an existing web site usually requires a level of planning for a flexible API and strong authentication. Endpoints handles authentication and API generation automatically for the developer, freeing them up to build out the application functionality. In addition, the use of App Engine simplifies scaling and ongoing maintenance for the API server.</p>
  <p>To add a mobile application to our video sharing site, the API server was built on App Engine. We also made use of Google Cloud Endpoints to facilitate authentication and rapid API development. Additionally, we chose to implement the backend in Java to illustrate the flexibility of language choices between different business components. Our mobile backend facilitates the upload of video content from the mobile application to Cloud Storage, creation of metadata in Cloud SQL and integration into the transcoding service via Task Queues.</p>
  <p>The mobile video application was written on Android utilizing the generated Cloud Endpoints libraries to quickly integrate the authentication and upload of videos. Additionally, videos are uploaded directly to Cloud Storage to avoid any additional latency or processing on the App Engine API Server. Authentication is handled seamlessly through Cloud Endpoints and permission is delegated to the Cloud Storage bucket for storing  video content. Permission delegation is an option on the bucket allowing users of the application to directly upload files. The combination of simplified authentication and API generation allowed for the rapid development of a complete mobile media solution.</p>

  </figure>

  <h3>Managing User Data Analysis</h3>
  <p>The analysis of user activity in applications can lead to an explosion of data along with the systems and software to retrieve meaningful results. Given the sporadic nature of most analysis, provisioned environments can sit idle for periods of time. However, when performing analysis, these systems can consume large amounts of computing resources and storage in order to complete in reasonable time frames. These characteristics make it a good fit for Compute Engine. The ability to rapidly spin up instances in response to a growing workload and to scale back when idle allows both small and large analysis jobs to be launched on demand. Additionally, the availability of capacity for expansion prevents bottlenecks associated with typical data processing environments.</p>
  <p>To process the expected volume of comments on our video application, we opted to use a Hadoop installation running on Compute Engine. Again, the Compute Engine API makes it easy to launch a Hadoop cluster of varying sizes for processing data. In our case, we are pulling comment data from the Cloud Datastore associated with our application and making a simple sentiment calculation for comments associated with a video. The Cloud Datastore data is automatically shared between the App Engine and the Compute Engine instances belonging to the same project. The end result of computing negative or positive total sentiment is written back to a Datastore entity associated with the video.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Google provides several alternatives for data analysis. Specifically for sentiment analysis, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/prediction/">Google Prediction API</a> provides a REST interface to a machine learning environment that, among other options, will conduct sentiment analysis for user data. For more general data analysis, <a href="https://developers.google.com/bigquery/">Google Big Query</a> provides an engine for processing terabytes of data without the overhead of custom development. Another great alternative for customizable Datastore processing is <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/dataprocessing/">App Engine Map Reduce</a>.</p>

  <h2>Managing Complexity</h2>
  <p>Given the range of logical services in our application, we made heavy use of several key features of the Google Cloud Platform. Together, they provide a strong base for supporting complex business applications in the cloud.</p>

  <h5>Cloud Endpoints</h5>
  <p>Cloud Endpoints is a collection of tools and services for generating REST APIs and client libraries from an App Engine application to simplify both web client and mobile client access. The combination allows for rapid rollout of an API server for Android applications. Cloud Endpoints simplifies communication with an App Engine application opening up the benefits of the available services, including:  Cloud <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore">Datastore</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/googlestorage">Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/mail">Mail</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue">Task Queue</a>s, etc. Behind the scenes, it converts the REST API calls to method invocation on the backend application and secures each call with OAuth 2.0 authentication. Existing development environments, including Eclipse, Android Studio and Apache Maven, currently offer functionality to generate a client library from within a project. Cloud Endpoints technology removes the overhead of API development and allows developers to focus on what really matters, their product.</p>
  <p>To get started with Google Cloud Endpoints, check out the <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/333508149">From Nothing to Nirvana in Minutes</a> session given at Google I/O 2013 and the developer documentation for <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/">Cloud Endpoints</a>. In addition, Google Cloud Endpoints are showcased in several solution samples including the  <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-endpoints-tictactoe-java">Web App</a>,  the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/articles/mobile-application-solutions">Mobile Shopping Assistant</a>, and the <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud/samples/mbs/">Mobile Backend Starter</a>.</p>

  <h5>Compute Engine API</h5>
  <p>The Compute Engine API provides a programmatic method to control a set of virtual machines in the Google Cloud Environment. Bare virtual machines can be launched and built up to needed specifications. Alternatively, machine images can be created beforehand to reduce the time required to launch them. Auto scaling can be achieved through periodic checks of machine load. Through the use of App Engine Task Queues, you can partition your work  and horizontally scale your processing environment. The benefits of Google Compute Engine can be harnessed to provide batch or custom processing for practically any workload.</p>
  <p>For more information on coordinating with the  Compute Engine API, check out our <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-load-balanced-gaming-server-on-google-compute-engine">Load Balanced Gaming Server Sample</a>. Note that even though the sample uses gaming as a scenario, many design patterns can be generalized to other scenarios as well.</p>

  <h5>Shared Data Storage</h5>
  <p>Data storage is deeply integrated into the Google Cloud Platform. From basic file storage to transaction object storage, there is a service to meet the needs of your application:  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cloud Storage provides a storage service for objects and files up to terabytes in size.</li>
    <li>Cloud SQL provides a relational SQL database based on MySQL.</li>
    <li>Cloud Datastore (App Engine Datastore) provides a NoSQL schemaless object datastore, with a query engine and atomic transactions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each of these services share a common theme of accessibility. They are built to be accessed from anywhere in the Cloud Platform and externally as well. All services represent a range of storage options for application developers. Whether you need the simplicity of a pure SQL implementation or opt for the scalability of NoSQL, there is an available database option for your application. <br>
      Authentication and authorization are automatically handled by the Google Cloud Platform. By default, applications are authorized to access other resources belonging to the same project. Service Account is a type of role account specific to your project that enables application access to resources. Outside of the Cloud Platform, certificate-based service accounts are available to enable secure access from remote locations. Service Accounts can be easily created and revoked from within the Cloud Project.</p>

  <h5>App Engine Modules</h5>
  <p>App Engine Modules allow teams to partition applications in components with separate requirements for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Scaling</li>
    <li>Deployments</li>
    <li>Versioning</li>
    <li>Performance Settings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Typical large scale applications are divided into logical services supporting the various aspects of the business. These components can support a number of areas including a corporate site, web applications, mobile access, customer API access, and administration portals. These different sites usually carry different service levels,  expected traffic, and processing requirements. Supporting these requirements in a typical managed environment usually forces the developer to choose the highest level of performance for all applications. App Engine Modules opens up the ability to customize an application into logical units but still maintain the benefits of a fully managed environment including optional auto scaling, automatic deployment versioning, and traffic splitting.</p>
  <p>The end result is an environment built for multiple teams and/or development languages. One App Engine application can support the diverse requirements of larger application. </p>
