					<h1>Reseller Technical Support Services Guidelines for Google Cloud Platform Services</h1>

          <p>The following technical support services guidelines ("Guidelines") apply to support services for Reseller’s Google Cloud Platform Reseller Agreement entered into by and between Google and Reseller (as may be applicable, the "Agreement") if that support is committed under the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>

          <h2>1. Support Request Submission</h2>

          <p>1.1 <strong>Reseller Efforts to Fix Errors</strong>. Prior to making a request to Google, Reseller will use reasonable efforts to fix any error, bug, malfunction or network connectivity defect without escalation to Google. Thereafter, a Reseller Contact may submit a written request for technical support through the GES site.</p>

          <p>1.2 <strong>Characterization of Requests</strong>. Reseller designates priority upon submission of Requests. Upon receiving a request, Google will determine whether the request is a "Service Unusable," "Standard Request" or a "Feature Request.” Any such determination made by Google is final and binding on Reseller. Google reserves the right to change Reseller’s priority designation if Google believes that Reseller’s designation is incorrect and will inform Reseller of any such change in its response to the support Request. Reseller may appeal any such reclassification to Google's Support management for review through any available support channel.</p>

          <p>1.3 <strong>Procedures for Acknowledgement and Resolution of Requests</strong>. When making a Request, Reseller will provide all requested diagnostic information and assist Google Support Personnel as may be required to resolve a Request.</p>

          <p>1.4 <strong>Request Acknowledgement</strong>. Google may respond to a Request by acknowledging receipt of the Request. Reseller acknowledges and understands that Google may be unable to provide answers to, or resolve all, Requests.</p>

          <p>1.5 <strong>Feature Requests</strong>. If Google deems a Request to be a Feature Request, Google will log such Request for consideration to add to a future update or release of the Services and will consider the matter closed. Google is under no obligation to respond to or resolve any Feature Request or to include any such Feature Request in any future update or release.</p>

          <p>1.6 <strong>Building Applications</strong>. For clarity, Google will not have any obligation to write or build any Applications or write code to facilitate Applications.</p>

          <h2>2. Accessing Support</h2>

          <p>2.1 <strong>Designated Support Contacts</strong>. Reseller will provide first-level support to End Users. Google will provide second-level support to Reseller only. If Reseller wishes to change its designated Contacts, it will notify Google via the GES Site at least five Business Days prior to the change. If on the date these updated Guidelines were first posted Reseller has more designated Contacts than are set forth under the applicable Support level under Section 4 below, the current Contacts will continue to be allowed until the expiration of the current license term for the applicable Services under the Agreement.</p>

          <p>2.2 <strong>Support Hours and Target Initial Response Times</strong>. Google will process Requests during the Hours of Operation, unless otherwise indicated in these Guidelines. Any Requests received outside of the Hours of Operation will be logged and processed at the beginning of the next Business Day. Target initial response times are based on the subscribed support level.</p>

          <h2>3. General Provisions</h2>

          <p>3.1 <strong>Maintenance</strong>. To ensure optimal performance of the Services, Google performs periodic Maintenance. In most cases, Maintenance will have limited or no negative impact on the availability and functionality of the Services. If Google expects planned Maintenance to negatively affect the availability or functionality of the Services, Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least seven days advance notice of the Maintenance. In addition, Google may perform emergency unscheduled Maintenance at any time. If Google expects such emergency unscheduled Maintenance to negatively affect the availability or functionality of the Services, Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of such Maintenance. Maintenance notices noted above will be provided via the GES Site.</p>

          <p>3.2 <strong>Language</strong>. The parties agree that all support provided by Google pursuant to these Guidelines will be provided in the English language.</p>

          <h2>4. Support Levels</h2>

          <p>4.1 <strong>Bronze</strong>. The Bronze support level includes the following, and Google will provide it to all resellers under the Agreement: automatic Services upgrades and maintenance updates, support for billing inquiries, access to documentation, white papers, online best practices guides, and community forums.</p>

          <p>4.2 <strong>Silver</strong>.
