          <h3 class="headline">Simple, repeatable deployments in the Cloud</h3>
          <p>Using Deployment Managerâ€™s declarative, parameterizable templates makes operations on the Cloud Platform simple and repeatable, and frees operations teams from the burden of managing the state of their infrastructure, or managing change.

        <div class="maia-col-4 inner-block">
          <h3 class="headline">Let Google look after your infrastructure</h3>
          <p>Deployment Manager can actively monitor the state of your resources both during and and after a template is deployed. It can reason about many types of Cloud Platform resources - removing the need to wire up many APIs.</p>

<div class="maia-col-4 inner-block">
          <h3 class="headline">Straightforward tools and deep integration</h3>
          <p>Use our simple scriptable command line interface to manage your deployments, or leverage a fully-featured oAuth 2.0 compliant RESTful API to integrate deeply into your own toolchain and workflows.</p>
